Carl's Notes (June 16th, 2013):

It is best to read through some of the Lapis U8 Documents before trying to run these sample programs...BUT, if you really want to jump in,
here are some starter tips...

1.) Open up the IDE (Code Editor Enviornment) from your Start Menu...All Programs\U8 Tools\nX-U8\IDE U8 GUI Enviornment

2.) Select File Open and point to a project (*.PID) in this directory such as: Q112 - Template\Q112-Template.PID

3.) Open this code example and start to read through the code to get an idea of what it contains

4.) To compile a project after you've made any desired changes, click Project/Rebuild

5.) If you were successful, you should see a success message in the console window at the bottom of the IDE:
	
	"Object was created by RLU8

	Convert End.

	Finished building"

6.) If you were not successful, we suggest you review some of the documentation that is installed with your U8 Dev Suite.

	Documents of most interest and in a reasonable order of importance:
	A.) IDEu8 Users Manual
	B.) DTU8 Debugger Manual
	C.) CCU8 Language Reference Manual
	D.) CCU8 Programming Guide
	E.) CCU8 User Guide
	F.) RTLU8 Runtime Library Reference Manual
	G.) nX-U8/100 Core Instruction Manual
	H.) nanoEASE (Debugger) User Manual 
	I.) nanoEASE (Debugger) Connection Manual
	J.) HTU8 User Manual (HEX Code Generator for ROM)
	K.) LCD Image Tool User Manual
	L.) MACU8 Assembler Package User Manual
	M.) Multiplication & Division Library User Manual
	N.) uEASE (Debugger) User Manual
	O.) uEASE (Debugger) Connection Manual
	P.) Dr.ICE (In-Circuit Emmulator) User Manual

	THESE 16 DOCUMENTS ARE FOUND IN THE U8 INSTALL DIRECTORY. YOU CAN REACH THEM FROM YOUR START MENU: 

	ALL PROGRAMS\U8 DEV TOOLS\nX-U8 DOcuments

7.) Read your LaPi User Manual and ensure your LaPi Board is connected to your computer

8.) You can launch the Debugger from...All Programs\U8 Tools\nX-U8\DT U8 Debugger

9.) Open a debugger example and start to read through the code to get an idea of what it contains (i.e.: Q112-GPIO_DEBUG_FILE.PDT)
